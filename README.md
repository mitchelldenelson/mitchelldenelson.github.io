Designed three well-fit models to predict infected and dead populations based on various predictors including health spending, GDP, smoking rate, etc. Data cleaning and transformation were performed to reduce overfitting and outliers in the data. Many data visualizations were employed to get a feel for the data and to determine collinearity amongst the predictors. Models were fit using multiple linear regression and various diagnostics, including visual and numerical (Adjusted R-Squared, Mallow's Cp, and Bayesian Information Criterion).  All models contained predictors that were significant at a significance level of at least 0.1 and the best model achieved an adjusted R-squared of 0.8173.
