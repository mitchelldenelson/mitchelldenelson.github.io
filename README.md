### COVID Infection Modeling 
[PDF](https://github.com/mitchelldenelson/Portfolio_and_Previous_Work/blob/main/R_Work/Covid_Modeling_Project/Covid_Infection_Modeling_R.pdf)

Designed three well-fit models to predict infected and dead populations based on various predictors including health spending, GDP, smoking rate, etc. Data cleaning and transformation were performed to reduce overfitting and outliers in the data. Many data visualizations were employed to get a feel for the data and to determine collinearity amongst the predictors. Models were fit using multiple linear regression and various diagnostics, including visual and numerical (Adjusted R-Squared, Mallow's Cp, and Bayesian Information Criterion).  All models contained predictors that were significant at a significance level of at least 0.1 and the best model achieved an adjusted R-squared of 0.8173.

### Equine Influenza Modeling
*As the book has yet to be released, no PDF is included to protect the author's data.

Analyzed Equine Influenza data from the 1870s in collaboration with the History Department. Performed data cleaning and transformation to combat non-specific dates of first transmission per town, among other difficulties when working with historical newspaper data.  Evaluated trends in the spread of influenza using GIS spatial analysis to provide insights on the travel of the disease and its impacts for an upcoming book.
